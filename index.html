    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p>This repository contains a growing collection of cursor rules designed to enhance your AI-powered coding experience. The rules range from practical general guidelines to specialized configurations for specific use cases, with some entertaining additions that make coding more enjoyable while maintaining productivity.</p>

    <h2>RULE INDEX</h2>
    <h3>♦️ <a href="./cursorrules_general.html">GENERAL</a></h3>
    <h3>♦️ <a href="./cursorrules_communication.html">COMMUNICATION</a></h3>
    <h3>♦️ <a href="./cursorrules_environment.html">ENVIRONMENT</a></h3>

    <h2>USAGE GUIDELINES</h2>
    <p>When implementing cursor rules, remember that <strong>less is more</strong>. It's crucial to select only the rules you actually need rather than activating everything available. Each person has their own coding style, conventions, and preferred workflow with AI assistants, so not every rule will suit your specific needs.</p>
    <p><strong>Key considerations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Context window impact</strong>: Every active rule consumes your model's context window, which may be limited or costly depending on your chosen AI model</li>
      <li><strong>Rule overload</strong>: Too many active rules can confuse the AI or cause it to ignore important guidelines entirely</li>
      <li><strong>Personal fit</strong>: Choose rules that align with your existing coding standards and project requirements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Start with a minimal set of essential rules and gradually add others only when you identify specific needs. This approach ensures optimal AI performance while maintaining the coding experience that works best for you.</p>
